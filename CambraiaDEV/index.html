        <h1 class="title">Hi! Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p class="white">My name is Rodrigo, I'm 21 years old (until now).
           I started studying web development since 2020, during the lockdown in Brazil, and I loved the way that my learning progress was flowing naturally, as I liked programming a lot, ( thanks to Gustavo Guanabara, the one who taught me a lot of nice things by Youtube) I joined in a 2 years course (technical level) from SENAC, with has remote classes, to acquire experience with web and mobile development in general.
        </p>
        <p class="white">Nowadays I am looking for a job to acquire experience, increase my programming knowledge, and also share everything I've learned until now with future colleagues and the programming community (who also helped me a lot during this time). Also, I hope to start studying System development and Analysis at university as soon as possible!</p>
